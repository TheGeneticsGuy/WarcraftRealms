# REALMS

**WHAT IT DOES**

* Parses all realm names for US, Europe, Korean, and Taiwan, on Retail, Classic Progression, and Classic Era servers direct from the Blizzard Warcraft web API.

* Outputs that into a file formatted and useful for GRM.

**PURPOSE**

* First, quality of life for myself, run the python script and instantly kick out updated server realm list.

* GRM has the ability to ban players. Being able to assist by using an autocomplete list of realm names will greatly help in players typing the server name.

* This is critical as of 11.0 release (The War Within patch) as it introduced cross-realm guilds. Now anyone can join.  You are not limited to just connected realms
